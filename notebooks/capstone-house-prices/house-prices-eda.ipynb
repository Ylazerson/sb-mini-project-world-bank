    "The objective of the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques#description) is to predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting.\n",

    "**Step 1: Ensure the data is in the [tidy-data](http://www.stat.wvu.edu/~jharner/courses/stat623/docs/tidy-dataJSS.pdf) format. Convert if needed.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Thankfully the data is already tidy:\n",
    "    -  Each variable forms a column\n",
    "    -  Each observation forms a row (in our case a single house)\n",
    "    -  Each type of observational unit forms a table (in our case only one table is needed)\n",
